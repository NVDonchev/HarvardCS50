0.  BMP supports up to 4 294 967 296 colors;
    GIF supports  up to 256 colors;
    JPEG supports up to 16777216 colors;
    PNG supports up to 281 474 976 710 656 colors;
    
1.  GIF format supports animation;

2.  If losseless compression is used, all of the original information that was available before the compression can be retrieved.
    If lossy compression is used, the image cannot be reversed to the exact state it was before the compression.
    Information loss is present during the compression;
    
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed;

4.  The sectors where the file is are marked as free space.
    Only the metadata of the hard disk changes, but the file's bits are still present;
    
5.  To ensure deleted files cannot be recovered, it is needed to overwrite the sectors where the file bits are.
    One way is to write zeroes over the bits and another more advanced is to write special sequences of bits.
    There are many programs on the market that let you do this;
    
6.  It's a header file for a library that declares several new types of variables.
    The already available variables are not good to use sometimes as their size depends on the implementation and the system;

7.  The point is to guarantee that the variables will have exactly the specified number of bits,
    independant of the system and the implementation. For example, uint32_t will contain exactly 32 bits;
    
8.  BYTE has 8 bits, DWORD has 32 bits, LONG has 32 bits and WORD has 16 bits;

9.  The first two bytes in a bmp, identifying the file format are 42 4d (in hexadecimal);

10. bfSize is the size of the whole bitmap file and biSize is the number of bytes needed by BITMAPINFOHEADER structure;

11. A negative biHeight means top-down bmp. It means that in the structure of the file,
    the first bits representing pixels correspond to the first pixels if the image;
    
12. BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMPâ€™s color depth in the biBitCount field;

13. fopen returns NULL if there is an error in trying to open the file for writing.

14. Because it gets only one chunk of data, aka one element at a time;

15. It assigns 1 to padding as the size must be multiple of 4. The closes multiple by 4 to 3 is 3 + 1 = 4;

16. fseek skips the offset bits by specifying the surrent position in the file and the number of bytes to be skipped;

17. SEEK_CUR indicated the current position in the file;

18. Mila Banana dun it.;
